	<h3>A Dataset I Manipulated Using Python</h3>
      		<a href = "https://github.com/asl45/team-assignment/tree/master/reasons">Link to project</a>
      			<p>For the group project, I manipulated a dataset on the reasons why about 300 Texas prisoners are no longer on death row. Many of the listed reasons were inconsistent, though, often including a prisoner number or names of facilities where prisoners were incarcerated, for example. To work with the data, I used a program to group similar entries together and rename them to be consistent. 
	This grouping was a necessary step to organize and analyze my information, but inevitably, I lost details in many entries. The process simplified my data, so the audience can only see the broad patterns in my information; this is a tolerable tradeoff for a project this size, but it was still a compromise. Additionally, some of the specifics I lost in some entires provided additional insight, like what charge an individual’s crime was reduced to or what exact natural cause an individual died from. This type of information is not necessary to understand the general reason a prisoner was removed from death row, but it can be mildly interesting to consider.
	Ideally, I would not have needed to run my information through a program to group many of the entires for consistency, but this was the only dataset I could find on this specific topic, and all of my group members pulled their datasets from the same website I did to make the project run more smoothly. In either case, I created a workable dataset that suited the project’s nature and scope. </p>
    
	  <h3>An Example of How I Made a Choice Related to Visualization Type </h3>
		<p>Link to projects <a href = "https://github.com/astryker18/data-viz-1">here </a>and <a href = "https://github.com/astryker18/viz_1_revision">here</a></p>
      			<p>When I created my project on how I typically spend my time each day, I chose my  visualization carefully because I was working with a large amount of information. A pie chart would be inefficient because I wanted to show the data for each day, and a page with 31 pie charts in a row is inefficient. A scatter plot would also be ineffective because I wanted to compare the days to each other, not just the hours on one category (and putting all categories into this plot would be cluttered and useless). I eventually settled on a bar chart with one bar for each day and bars for each category layered on top of one another. This made it easy to compare categories between days but also within the same day, and it was the most effective visualization choice for my data. 
	I converted my visualization to a histogram in my revision, essentially distributing the overlapping bars right next to one another. This choice was similar enough to my original visualization to be effective, but it placed new emphasis on comparing categories within days instead of across days because the bars were in distinct, dated sections. This arrangement was more aesthetically pleasing, as it spread the large amount of information over a greater area, but it somewhat diluted my project’s purpose (determining where my time generally went during the month, not each day). Both approaches had their advantages, and I was purposeful in my graph-type selection.</p>
    
	  <h3>An Example of How I Made a Choice Related to Design Elements</h3>
    		<a href = "https://github.com/asl45/team-assignment/tree/master/reasons">Link to project</a>
      			<p>For my piechart in the group project, I manipulated color, text, and other elements to ensure my visualization was informative and aesthetically pleasing. I decided to make my chart a color wheel to make it eye-catching and appealing, so I changed the text to a bold, black font so the captions harmonized with the rest of the colors. This choice was especially important for the percentages, as they were in the colored areas and needed to be visible. Additionally, I spaced the percentages away from the chart’s center so they were readable, but I kept the captions close to the circle’s edge to make it clear which slice represented which category. I also exploded some of the smaller slices so they would not be lost in the rest of the information and there was adequate room for the percentages.
	For the general public, this design is attention-grabbing and informative enough, but I would make small tweaks for an expert audience. I would expand the graph’s size so I could include more categories and slices, and I would change the color scheme to something more muted to let the information stand on its own. Experts would be less interested in the design of a visualization and more concerned with the actual data it contains, so I would revise accordingly.

    <h3>An Example of How I Made a Choice Related to Comparisons</h3>
	  <a href = "https://github.com/astryker18/data-viz-2">Link to project</a>
      		<p>For my second visualization project, I compared the number of bus stops to the number of Healthy Ride bike racks in each Pittsburgh neighborhood (after doing my first visualization project on my daily habits, I wanted to use a public dataset). To do so, I used a bar chart and layered the bike rack bar on top of the bus stop bar to show just how large the discrepancy was between the two figures. The visualization came out as well as I had hoped, showing the gap between the figures effectively. Some minor things could be improved with a revision, though. Since the number of bike racks never rises above 10 but the bus stops sometimes numbered well past 100, it was a little difficult to tell exactly how many bike racks were in each neighborhood. Inserting a small break in the y-axis would allow me to make the bike rack bars bigger without expanding the bus stop bars to an absurd distance. Overall, though, I felt my visualization did its job well.</p>
    
	  <h3>An Example of Something That Frustrated Me and Took Longer Than I Anticipated</h3>
		<a href = "https://github.com/astryker18/data-viz-1">Link to project</a>
      			<p>I had a great deal of trouble with my first visualization, and though I worked for countless hours on it, I was never satisfied with it. I was examining the number of hours I spent on different activities each day, and I wanted to have bars for each category layered on each date. It seemed simple in theory, but when I actually put the graph together, it was unreadable. Every bar began near the bottom, and instead of neatly layering into distinct blocks, the colors blended together and made a lovely shade of brown. I tried manipulating the colors and alpha values to no avail, and even when I eliminated the shading altogether and just used the outlines of the bars, everything was cluttered and almost indecipherable. Additionally, because I had to use a garish color scheme to make the bar outlines visible, the entire graph was a blinding eyesore. Even with an extension, I could not solve these issues before the deadline (partially because I could not successfully create a data frame and had to spend a few hours typing in all my data by hand). Now, I know how to use pandas for my information, and I wish I sought out help earlier in the process. I was afraid to admit defeat, but I sealed my own fate with my stubbornness, and I started actively seeking advice and input from others after this project. Admitting I was a beginner and needed help made me far more successful in later projects.</p>
    
	  <h3>An Example of Something I Am Particularly Proud Of</h3>
    		<a href = "https://github.com/asl45/team-assignment/tree/master/reasons">Link to project</a>
      			<p>I am rather proud of my visualization for the group project. It took a lot of work from start to finish, and it was the first project that I felt I actually had a handle on the expectations and knew how to actually execute them with the help of others. 
	To assemble the data for the visualization, I began with a chart on a webpage and used a program to export the data into a csv (based on a group member’s recommendation). I then used another program, recommended by a different group member, to group similar entries into larger categories, adjusting small grammar discrepancies in places and completely rephrasing in others. Next, I had to go through the csv and manually adjust some of the entries in even smaller ways (such as removing prisoner numbers). Even after all of that, there were some entries that stubbornly defied categorization, so I decided to make an “Other” slice on my pie chart for them. Matt showed me how to use the counter function to group entries together that occurred only once in my dataset. I would never have been able to make this project as successful as I did without help from several human resources.
	Then, I had to create the visualization. I became more familiar with hex color codes, and I played with spacing for the captions, percentages, and exploded slices. I manipulated other properties of the chart as well, such as the lines between slices and the location of the first and largest slice. The visualization itself is not very complicated, but the amount of work and manipulation that went into it was substantial, and I am proud I was able to accomplish so much for one project.</p>
